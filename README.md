## Local Setup

```

npx prisma generate
```

3. Push the schema to your Neon database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Auth Notes

- Auth.js is configured with credentials authentication.
- Users are created through `POST /api/auth/register`.
- Protected routes live under `/dashboard`.

## AI Notes

- Resume bullet actions call `POST /api/ai/resume-bullets`.
- Cover letter generation calls `POST /api/ai/cover-letter`.
- If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing, the app returns a safe fallback message instead of breaking.
